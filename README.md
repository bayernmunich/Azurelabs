Here are some quick start guides on **Azure tools for Visual Studio** that will guide you on how you can easily build, debug, deploy, diagnose, and managemulti-platform,
scalable apps and services on Azure with Visual Studio.

Visual Studio 2015 also includes the latest [Azure SDK](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/) providing one-click provisioning and deployment to Azure for web sites and cloud services, along with easy management
of all or your cloud resources. Whether your application is using [IaaS or Paas in Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/overview/what-is-paas/), built with .NET or Python or Node.js, or deploying to Windows or Linux or Docker 
containers, the cloud tools in Visual Studio 2015 let you easily integrate with Azure.

On top of this, developers can also use the preview of [ASP.NET 5](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/introducing-asp-net-5) in Visual Studio 2015. ASP.NET 5 is one of the most significant updates to the **ASP.NET** platform we’ve done.
Because ASP.NET 5 runs on the **CoreCLR**, it can be deployed to your choice of platform, whether it’s **Linux, Mac or Windows**. On top of this, **ASP.NET 5** offers foundational improvements
in rapid development, cloud configuration, dependency management and composability.

It has the following labs:
